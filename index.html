    <p>Hi! I'm Meira, a PhD Student at the University of Washington's Information School where I'm advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kotut/">Dr. Lindah Kotut.</a></p>
    <p>My resarch interest is in digital privacy, and I'm currently focused on how technology -- particularly social media platforms -- poses privacy risks or fosters new forms of interpersonal surveillance. I'm focused on questions such as:

<ul>
<li>How and why do people monitor, surveil, and disclose information about others?</li>
<li>What are the harms and risks (privacy related or otherwise) of these practices?</li>
</ul>

<p>To address the first question, I use qualitative HCI methods to analyze user behaviors, perceptions, and reactions to digital surveillance practices. To address the second, I rely on work from usable privacy & security to conduct risk assessments of these technologies, and surveillance studies to critically address how these practices engage with identity and power. 
  Ultimately, I am motivated by a desire for privacy, safety, and autonomy for all users.
</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I was a privacy program manager at Meta. I recieved my Bachelor's in Information Science from Cornell University.
</p>

<p> When I'm not researching privacy, I love to üìñ read, üèïÔ∏è spend time outside, and hang out with my two cats, üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Scallion and üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Pancake.</p>
